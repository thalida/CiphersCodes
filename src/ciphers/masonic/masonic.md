## It's faked y'all!
So, what had happened was, the {{cipher.NAME}} cipher is geometric. Which means that it's not easily translated to English characters. So, it's currently being rendered by a font. If you copy the text you'll notice it's not actually encoded at all.

I cheated. I feel bad. But, not really 'cause I wasn't rendering all 'em characters in css or printing out an image.

That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
